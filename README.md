## Description

Back in October, 2024, a Bulgarian company Utilities Services Ltd. requested a website development of a Water Calculator, that is adapted to the Bulgarian conditions.

_"The creation of a pilot project for a "Water Calculator", adapted to Bulgarian conditions, will contribute enormously to informing consumers of different ages and types of households: about what their monthly consumption is, whether they use energy-saving and water-efficient appliances, whether they have internal leaks in the network; whether they can reduce the use of the drinking resource. Furthermore it will a helpful educational tool in terms of climate-changed conditions in the last 5 years in half of the territory of Bulgaria due to the draft and lack of raw water to several regions."_

## Sections
The app has 3 form sections:
- [Indoor Water](https://git.fhict.nl/I524517/passion-project/-/tree/Indoor-Water) - _How does the water consumption work inside the household?_
- [Outdoor Water](https://git.fhict.nl/I524517/passion-project/-/tree/Outdoor-Water) - _How does the water consumption work outside (gardening, pool...) the household?_
- [Virtual Water](https://git.fhict.nl/I524517/passion-project/-/tree/Virtual-Water) - _There are almost invisible ways to waste a lot of water, is the user aware of them?_

It ends with a Results page with useful tips.
